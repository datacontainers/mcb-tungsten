Welcome to Kodiak Data/Continuent Demo!

There are a couple of steps involved to get connected:

Step 1: Get OpenVPN access to MemCloud.  There are three steps:
 (1) Download VPN client
 (2) Install VPN client
 (3) Add VPN profile, see Step 2

For MacOS, Windows and Linux users, there is a separate set of Step 1 instructions, which can be found here: https://goo.gl/dUKtWq

Step 2: Download, add your VPN profile, found here: {{thisdemoaccount.ovpnlink | safe }}

Step 3: After establishing VPN you can access the demo cluster:
   * MySQL via ssh at: {{thisdemoaccount.sshcreds1 | safe}}
   * MongoDB via ssh at: {{thisdemoaccount.sshcreds2 | safe}}
